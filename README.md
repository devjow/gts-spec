# Global Type System (GTS) Specification

This document defines GTS — a simple, human-readable, globally unique identifier and referencing system for data type definitions (e.g., JSON Schemas) and data instances (e.g., JSON objects). It is specification-first, language-agnostic, and intentionally minimal, with primary focus on JSON and JSON Schema.

The GTS identifiers are strings in a format like:

```
gts.<vendor>.<package>.<namespace>.<type>.v<MAJOR>[.<MINOR>]
```

They can be used instead of UUID, ULID, URN, JSON Schema URL, XML Namespace URI, or other notations for identification of various objects and schema definitions like:

- API data types and typed payloads (e.g. custom resource attributes)
- RPC contracts schemas
- API errors, headers and various semantics definitions
- Event catalogs, messages and stream topics
- Workflow categories and instances
- FaaS functions or actions contract definitions
- Policy objects (RBAC/ABAC/IAM)
- UI elements, schemas and forms
- Observability payloads (e.g. log formats)
- IoT/Edge telemetry data (e.g. device message formats)
- Warehouse/lake schemas
- Enumerations and references (e.g. enum id + description)
- ML/AI artifacts (e.g. model metadata or MCP tools declarations)
- Configuration-as-data templates and config instances
- Testing artifacts (e.g. golden records and fixtures)
- Database schemas
- Compliance and audit objects

Besides being a universal identifier, GTS provides concrete, production-ready capabilities that solve common architectural challenges for platform vendors and service providers integrating multiple third-party services under single control plane. In particular:

- **Extensible plugin architectures**: Third-party vendors can safely extend platform base types such as custom API fields, events, settings, configs, UI elements, user roles, licensing, etc.
- **Cross-vendor type safety**: Validate contracts (APIs, events, configs, etc.) across multiple vendors with automated compatibility checking in a middleware layer
- **Hybrid database storage**: Store base type fields in indexed columns for fast queries, vendor-specific extensions in JSON/JSONB—no schema migrations needed
- **Granular access control**: Use wildcard patterns and attribute-based policies for fine-grained type-based authorization (ABAC) without maintaining explicit lists
- **Human-readable debugging**: Identifiers encode vendor, package, namespace, and version—instantly comprehensible in logs and traces
- **Schema evolution without downtime**: Add optional fields, register new derived types, and deploy producers/consumers independently

## 1. Motivation

The proliferation of distributed systems, microservices, and event-driven architectures has created a significant challenge in maintaining **data integrity**, **system interoperability**, and **type governance** across organizational boundaries and technology stacks.

Existing identification methods—such as opaque UUIDs, simple URLs (e.g. JSON Schema URLs), or proprietary naming conventions—fail to address the full spectrum of modern data management requirements. The **Global Type System (GTS)** is designed to solve these systemic issues by providing a simple, structured, and self-describing mechanism for identifying and referencing data types (schemas) and data instances (objects).

The primary value of GTS is to provide a single, universal identifier that is immediately useful for:

### 1.1 Unifying Data Governance and Interoperability

**Human- and Machine-Readable**: GTS identifiers are semantically meaningful, incorporating vendor, package, namespace, and version information directly into the ID. This makes them instantly comprehensible to developers, architects, and automated systems for logging, tracing, and debugging.

**Vendor and Domain Agnostic**: By supporting explicit vendor registration, GTS facilitates safe, cross-vendor data exchange (e.g., in event buses or plugin systems) while preventing naming collisions and ensuring the origin of a definition is clear.

### 1.2 Enforcing Type Safety and Extensibility

**Explicit Schema/Instance Distinction**: The GTS naming format clearly separates a type definition (schema) from a concrete data instance, enabling unambiguous schema resolution and validation.

**Inheritance and Conformance Lineage**: The chained identifier system provides a robust, first-class mechanism for expressing type derivation and instance conformance. This is critical for ecosystems where third-parties must safely extend core types while guaranteeing compatibility with the base schema.

**Built-in Version Compatibility**: By adopting a constrained Semantic Versioning model, GTS inherently supports automated compatibility checking across minor versions. This simplifies data casting (upcast/downcast), allowing consumers to safely process data from newer schema versions without breaking.

### 1.3 Simplifying Policy and Tooling

**Granular Access Control**: The structured nature of the identifier enables the creation of coarse-grained access control policies using wildcard matching (e.g., granting a service permission to process all events from a specific vendor/package: gts.myvendor.accounting.*).

**Deterministic Opaque IDs**: GTS supports the deterministic derivation of UUIDs (v5), providing a stable, fixed-length key for database indexing and external system APIs where human-readability is not required, while maintaining a clear, auditable link back to the source type.

**Specification-First**: As a language- and format-agnostic specification (though prioritizing JSON/JSON Schema), GTS provides a stable foundation upon which robust, interchangeable validation and parsing tools can be built across any ecosystem.


## 2. Identifier Format

GTS identifiers name either a schema (type) or an instance (object). A single GTS identifier may also chain multiple identifiers to express inheritance/compatibility and an instance’s conformance lineage.

The GTS identifier is a string with total length of 1024 characters maximum.

### 2.1 Canonical form

- A single type identifier (schema):
  - `gts.<vendor>.<package>.<namespace>.<type>.v<MAJOR>[.<MINOR>]~`
  - Note the trailing `~` to denote a type (schema) identifier.
- A single instance identifier (object):
  - `gts.<vendor>.<package>.<namespace>.<type>.v<MAJOR>[.<MINOR>]`
  - Note: no trailing `~` for instances. The identifier ends with an integer (the last version component).

The `<vendor>` refers to a string code that indicates the origin of a given schema or instance definition. This can be valuable in systems that support cross-vendor data exchange, such as events or configuration files, especially in environments with deployable applications or plugins.

The `<package>` notation defines a module, plugin, or application provided by the vendor that contains the specified GTS definition.

The `<namespace>` specifies a category of GTS definitions within the package, and finally, the `<type>` defines the specific object type.

Segments must be lowercase ASCII letters, digits, and underscores; they must start with a letter or underscore: `[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*`. The single underscore `_` is reserved as a placeholder and may only be used for the `<namespace>` segment.

The `<vendor>`, `<package>`, `<namespace>`, and `<type>` segment tokens must not start with a digit.

Versioning uses semantic versioning constrained to major and optional minor: `v<MAJOR>[.<MINOR>]` where `<MAJOR>` and `<MINOR>` are non-negative integers, for example:
- `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~` - defines a base event type in the system
- `gts.x.core.events.type.v1.2~` - defines a specific edition v1.2 of the base event type

**Examples** - The GTS identifier can be used for instance or type identifiers:
```bash
gts.x.idp.users.user.v1.0~ # defines ID of a schema of the user objects provided by vendor 'x' in scope of the package 'idp'
gts.x.mq.events.topic.v1~ # defines ID of a schema of the MQ topic stream provided by vendor 'x' in scope of the 'mq' (message queue) package

```

### 2.2 Chained identifiers

Multiple GTS identifiers can be chained with `~` to express derivation and conformance. The chain follows **left-to-right inheritance** semantics:

- Pattern: `gts.<segment1>~<segment2>~<segment3>`
- Where **<segment>** is a single GTS identifier segment: `<vendor>.<package>.<namespace>.<type>.v<MAJOR>[.<MINOR>]`
  - `<segment1>` is a **base type** (schema ID ending with `~`)
  - `<segment2>` is a **derived/refined type** (schema ID ending with `~`) that extends `<segment1>` with additional constraints or implementation-specific details. It MUST be compatible with `<segment1>`.
  - `<segment3>` is an **instance identifier** (no trailing `~`) that conforms to `<segment2>`. By transitivity, it also conforms to `<segment1>`.

**Important:** Each type in the chain inherits from its immediate predecessor (left neighbor) and MUST maintain compatibility.

**Chaining rules:**
1. All elements except the rightmost MUST be type identifiers (conceptually ending with `~`).
2. The rightmost element determines the identifier's nature:
   - Ends with `~` → the whole identifier represents a **type/schema**.
   - No trailing `~` → the whole identifier represents an **instance/object**.
3. The `gts.` prefix appears **only once** at the very beginning of the identifier string.
4. Segments after the first are considered relative identifiers and do not repeat the `gts.` prefix. (e.g., `gts.x.some.base.type.v1~vendor.app.some.derived.v1~`).
5. Use `_` as a placeholder when the namespace is not applicable

**Examples with explanations:**

``` bash
# Base type only (standalone schema)
gts.x.core.events.type.v1~

# Type `ven.app._.custom_event.v1` derives from base type `gts.x.core.events.type.v1`. Both are schemas (trailing `~`).
gts.x.core.events.type.v1~ven.app._.custom_event.v1~

# Instance `ven.app._.custom_event_topic.v1.2` (no trailing `~`) conforms to type `gts.x.core.events.topic.v1`. The identifier shows the full inheritance chain.
gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~ven.app._.custom_event_topic.v1.2
```

### 2.3 Formal Grammar (EBNF)

The complete GTS identifier syntax in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF):

```ebnf
(* Top-level identifier *)
gts-identifier = "gts." , gts-segment , [ chain-suffix ] ;

(* Chain of type extensions *)
chain-suffix   = { "~" , gts-segment } , [ final-tilde ] ;
final-tilde    = "~" ;  (* present for type IDs, absent for instance IDs *)

(* Single GTS ID segment *)
gts-segment    = vendor , "." , package , "." , namespace , "." , type , "." , version ;

vendor         = segment ;
package        = segment ;
namespace      = segment ;
type           = segment ;

(* Segment: lowercase letters, digits, underscores; starts with letter or underscore *)
segment        = ( letter | "_" ) , { letter | digit | "_" } ;

(* Version: major.minor or major only *)
version        = "v" , major , [ "." , minor ] ;
major          = "0" | positive-integer ;
minor          = "0" | positive-integer ;

(* Primitives *)
positive-integer = non-zero-digit , { digit } ;
letter           = "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" | "j"
                 | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t"
                 | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z" ;
digit            = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
non-zero-digit   = "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
```

**Grammar notes:**

1. **Type vs Instance distinction**: A GTS identifier ending with `~` (final-tilde present) denotes a type/schema. Without the trailing `~`, it denotes an instance.

2. **Chain interpretation**: In a chained identifier `gts.<gts-segment1>~<gts-segment2>~<gts-segment3>`, each `~` acts as a separator. All segments before the final segment MUST be types (conceptually ending with `~`). The final segment determines whether the entire identifier is a type or instance.

3. **Placeholder rule**: Use `_` (underscore) as a segment value when the namespace is not applicable. It is recommended to use the placeholder only for the `<namespace>` segment.

4. **Normalization**: GTS identifiers must be lowercase. Leading/trailing whitespace is not permitted. Canonical form has no optional spacing.

5. **Reserved prefix**: The `gts.` prefix is mandatory and reserved. Future versions may introduce alternative prefixes but will maintain backward compatibility.


## 3. Semantics and Capabilities

GTS identifiers enable the following operations and use cases:

### 3.1 Core Operations

1. **Global Identification**: Uniquely identify data types (JSON Schemas) and data instances (JSON objects) in a human-readable format across systems and vendors.

2. **Schema Resolution and Validation**:
   - For a type identifier (ending with `~`): resolve to the JSON Schema definition
   - For an instance identifier: extract the rightmost type from the chain and validate the object against that schema
   - Chain validation: optionally verify that each type in the chain is compatible with its predecessor

3. **Version Compatibility Checking**: Automatically determine if schemas with different MINOR versions are compatible (see section 4).

4. **Access Control Policies**: Build fine-grained or coarse-grained authorization rules using:
   - Exact identifier matching
   - Wildcard patterns (e.g., `gts.vendor.package.*`)
   - Chain-based isolation (e.g., restrict access to specific vendor's extensions)
   - See also ABAC use-cases in sections 3.3 and 3.4 below

5. **Extensible Type Systems**: Enable platforms where:
   - Base system types are defined by a core vendor
   - Third-party vendors extend base types with additional constraints
   - All validation guarantees are preserved through the inheritance chain
   - Type evolution is tracked explicitly through versioning

### 3.2 GTS Types Inheritance

GTS chained identifiers express type derivation through **left-to-right inheritance**. In a chain like `gts.A~B~C`:

- Type `B` extends type `A` by adding constraints or refining field definitions
- Type `C` further extends type `B` in the same manner
- Each derived type MUST be **fully compatible** with its predecessor (see section 4.3)

**Compatibility guarantee**: Every valid instance of a derived type is also a valid instance of all its base types in the chain. This means:
- An instance conforming to `C` also conforms to `B` and `A`
- Validation against the rightmost type automatically ensures conformance to all base types
- Derived types can only add optional fields (in open models), tighten constraints, or provide more specific definitions—never break base type contracts

This inheritance model enables safe extensibility: third-party vendors can extend platform base types while maintaining full compatibility with the core system.

**Implementation pattern: Hybrid storage for extensible schemas**

GTS types inheritance enables a powerful database design pattern that combines **structured storage** for base type fields with **flexible JSON storage** for derived type extensions. This approach provides:

- **Query performance**: Index and query base type fields using native database types
- **Extensibility**: Store vendor-specific extensions as JSON/JSONB without schema migrations
- **Type safety**: Validate all data against registered GTS schemas before storage
- **Multi-tenancy**: Support multiple vendors extending the same base type in a single table

**Example: Event Management Platform**

A platform defines a base event schema with common fields:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "id": { "type": "string" },
    "typeId": { "type": "string" },
    "occurredAt": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" },
    "payload": { "type": "object", "additionalProperties": true }
  },
  "required": ["id", "typeId", "occurredAt", "payload"]
}
```

A third-party vendor (ABC) registers a derived event type for order placement:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~abc.events.order_placed.v1~", // define a new event type derived from the base event type
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~" }, // inherit base event schema
    {
      "properties": {
        "typeId": { "const": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~abc.orders.order_placed.v1~" },
        "payload": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": { // define the payload structure specific for this new event type
            "orderId": { "type": "string" },
            "customerId": { "type": "string" },
            "totalAmount": { "type": "number" },
            "items": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object" } }
          },
          "required": ["orderId", "customerId", "totalAmount", "items"],
          "additionalProperties": false
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The platform stores all events in a single table using hybrid storage:

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,     -- Indexed for fast event fetch by ID
    type_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,   -- Indexed for filtering by event type
    occurred_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,  -- Indexed for time-range queries
    payload JSONB NOT NULL,          -- Vendor-specific extensions stored as JSON
    INDEX idx_type_occurred (type_id, occurred_at)
);
```

**Benefits of this approach:**

1. **No schema migrations**: New event types are registered via GTS schemas, not database DDL
2. **Efficient queries**: Filter by `type_id` or `occurred_at` using indexes, then parse `payload` only for matching rows
3. **Vendor isolation**: Use `type_id` patterns (e.g., `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~abc.*`) for access control (see 3.5)
4. **Full validation**: All events are validated against their registered GTS schema before insertion, ensuring data quality despite flexible storage


### 3.3 Query Language

GTS Query Language is a compact predicate syntax, inspired by XPath/JSONPath, that lets you constrain results by attributes. Attach a square-bracket clause to a GTS identifier with space-separated name="value" pairs. Example form: <gts>[ attr="value", other="value2" ].

> **Scope note:** The query language and attribute selector (section 3.4) are runtime conveniences for filtering and accessing data in GTS-aware applications. They are **not part of the core GTS identifier specification** and should not be embedded in stored identifiers or schema definitions. Use them only in runtime queries, policy evaluation, and data access operations.

Predicates can reference plain literals or GTS-formatted values, e.g.:

```bash
# filter all events that are published to the topic "some_topic" by the vendor "z"
gts.x.core.events.type.v1~[type_id="gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~z.app._.some_topic.v1~"]
# filter all user settings that were defined for users if type is z-vendor app_admin
gts.x.core.acm.user_setting.v1~[user_type="gts.x.core.acm.user.v1~z.app._.app_admin.v1~"]
```

Multiple parameters are combined with logical AND to further restrict the result set:

```bash
gts.x.y.z.type.v1~[foo="bar", id="ef275d2b-9f21-4856-8c3b-5b5445dba17d"]
```

### 3.4 Attribute selector

GTS includes a lightweight attribute accessor, akin to JSONPath dot notation, to read a single value from a bound instance. Append `@` to the identifier and provide a property path, e.g., <gts>@<root>.<nested>.

The selector always resolves from the instance root and returns one attribute per query. For example:

```bash
# refer to the value of the message identifier
gts.x.y.z.message.v1@id
```

Nested attributes also can be accessed within the instance's structure. For example:
```bash
# refer to the value of the 'bar' item property from the 'foo' field
gts.x.y.z.message.v1.0@foo.bar
```

### 3.5 Access control with wildcards

Wildcards (`*`) enable policy scopes that cover families of identifiers (e.g., entire vendor/package trees) rather than single, exact instance or schema IDs. This is useful in RBAC/ABAC style engines and relationship-based systems (e.g., Zanzibar-like models) where permissions are expressed over sets of resources.

```bash
# grants access to all the audit events category defined by the vendor 'xyz'
gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core._.audit_event.v1~xyz.*
# grants access to all the menu items referring screens of the vendor 'abc'
gts.x.ui.left_menu.menu_item.v1[screen_type="gts.x.ui.core_ui.screens.v1~abc.*"]
```

### 3.6 Access Control Implementation Notes

> **Scope disclaimer:** GTS-based access control implementation is outside the scope of this specification and will vary across systems. GTS provides the syntax to express authorization rules; however, different policy engines may apply different evaluation strategies or may not support attribute-based or wildcard-based access control at all.

The following guidance is provided for implementers building GTS-aware policy engines:

**Policy management domain model:**
- **Principal**: Users, services, or groups (outside the scope of GTS) mapped to roles.
- **Resource**: GTS identifiers or patterns (with wildcards and, optionally, attribute predicates) that denote types or instances.
- **Action**: Verbs such as `read`, `write`, `emit`, `subscribe`, `admin` defined by the platform.

**Example policy shapes:**
- **RBAC-style allow**: Role `xyz_auditor` → allow `read` on `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core._.audit_event.v1~xyz.*`
- **ABAC refinement**: Attach predicate filters like `[screen_type="..."]` to restrict by referenced type.
- **Derived-type envelopes**: Grant access at the base type (e.g., `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~`) so that derived schemas remain covered if they conform by chain rules.

**Matching semantics options:**
- **Segment-wise prefixing**: The `*` wildcard can match any valid content of the target segment and its suffix hierarchy, enabling vendor/package/namespace/type grouping.
- **Chain awareness**: Patterns may target the base segment, derived segments, or instance tail; evaluation should consider the entire chain when present.
- **Attribute filters**: Optional `[name="value", ...]` predicates further constrain matches (e.g., only instances referencing a specific `screen_type`).
- **Minor version semantics**: Patterns without minor versions (e.g., `gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v1~*`) match candidates with any minor version of that major version (e.g., `v1.0~`, `v1.1~`), since the minor version is optional and omitting it means "any minor version". See section 10 for detailed examples.

**Evaluation guidelines:**
- **Deny-over-allow (recommended)**: If your engine supports explicit denies, process them before allows to prevent privilege escalation.
- **Most-specific wins**: Prefer the most specific matching rule (longest concrete prefix, fewest wildcards, most predicates).
- **Version safety**: Consider pinning MAJOR and, optionally, MINOR versions in sensitive paths; otherwise rely on minor-version compatibility guarantees (see section 4).
- **Tenant isolation**: Use vendor/package scoping to isolate tenants and applications; avoid cross-vendor wildcards unless explicitly required.

**Performance guidelines:**
- **Indexing**: Normalize and index rules by canonical GTS prefix to avoid expensive pattern-matching scans.
- **Caching**: Cache resolution results for common patterns and predicate evaluations; invalidate caches on schema or policy changes.
- **Auditing**: Log the concrete identifier and the matched rule (pattern + predicates) for traceability and compliance.


## 4. GTS Identifier Versions Compatibility

GTS uses semantic versioning with MAJOR and optional MINOR components. This section covers two distinct compatibility concepts:

**1. Type Derivation Compatibility** (via chaining): A derived type like `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.0~` must be **always fully compatible** with its base type `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~`. Derived types refine base types by adding constraints or specifying fields left open (e.g., `payload` as `object` with `additionalProperties: true`).

**2. Minor Version Compatibility** (same type, different versions): When evolving a single type across minor versions (e.g., `v1.0` → `v1.1` → `v1.2`), compatibility depends on the chosen strategy:

- **MAJOR version increments** (v1 → v2): Always indicate breaking changes
- **MINOR version increments** (v1.0 → v1.1): Must maintain compatibility according to one of three strategies: backward, forward, or full compatibility

The compatibility mode for minor version evolution is **implementation-defined** and can vary depending on system component implementing the API or DB storage, namespace or use case. For example:
- Event schemas might use **forward compatibility** (old consumers can read new events)
- API request payloads might use **backward compatibility** (new servers can process old requests)
- Configuration schemas might require **full compatibility** (any version can read any other)

### 4.1 Compatibility Modes

Before we dig deeper into the GTS versions compatibility, let's first define the different compatibility modes:

**Backward Compatibility**: A consumer with the **new schema** can process data produced with an **old schema**.
- **Use case**: Consumers are updated after producers (e.g., API clients updated before servers).
- **Guarantee**: New code can read old data.

**Forward Compatibility**: A consumer with the **old schema** can process data produced with a **new schema**.
- **Use case**: Producers are updated before consumers, or to support rollback scenarios.
- **Guarantee**: Old code can read new data.

**Full Compatibility**: Changes are both backward and forward compatible.
- **Use case**: Producers and consumers can be deployed in any order.
- **Guarantee**: Maximum safety but most restrictive evolution path.

> **Implementation note**: The exact compatibility mode is implementation-defined and outside the scope of this specification. Systems may enforce different modes for different identifier namespaces

### 4.2 JSON Schema Content Models

Understanding `additionalProperties` is critical for compatibility:

- **Open content model**: `additionalProperties` is `true` or not specified. The schema accepts fields not explicitly defined.
- **Closed content model**: `additionalProperties` is `false`. The schema rejects any fields not explicitly defined.

These models affect which changes are safe:
- Adding a field to a **closed** model is backward compatible (old data has no extra fields; new consumers handle absence).
- Adding/removing optional fields in an **open** model is fully compatible (open consumers accept any fields; optional fields can be absent).

### 4.3 Compatibility Rules for GTS Schemas

The table below shows which schema changes between minor versions of the same type are safe for each compatibility mode.

> NOTE: The table below illustrates the compatibility rules for GTS schemas of the same type, but different versions. The derived types are always fully compatible with the base type.

| Change | Backward | Forward | Full | Notes |
|--------|----------|---------|------|-------|
| **Adding optional property (open model)** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Old consumers ignore new fields (open model accepts any fields). New consumers handle absence of optional field. |
| **Removing optional property (open model)** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | New consumers ignore the removed field in old data (open model accepts any fields). Old consumers handle absence of optional field. |
| **Updating description/examples** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Documentation changes don't affect validation. |
| **Updating minor version of referenced GTS types** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Assumes referenced types follow same compatibility rules. |
| **Adding optional property (closed model)** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | Old data lacks the field; new consumers handle absence. Old consumers reject new data with extra fields. |
| **Changing required property to optional** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | New consumers handle absence. Old data always provides it. |
| **Removing enum value** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | New consumers handle remaining values. Old data may use removed value. |
| **Widening numeric type (int → number)** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | Old data (integers) is subset of new type. Old consumers may not handle floats. |
| **Relaxing constraints (e.g., increasing max)** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | Old data satisfies looser constraints. Old consumers reject values outside old limits. |
| **Removing optional property (closed model)** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Old consumers expect the field may be absent. New data won't have it. |
| **Changing optional property to required** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Old consumers don't expect it to be required. New data always provides it. |
| **Adding new enum value** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Old data uses existing values. New consumers handle new values. Old consumers reject unknown values. |
| **Narrowing numeric type (number → int)** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | New consumers accept integers only. Old data may contain floats. |
| **Tightening constraints (e.g., decreasing max)** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | New consumers enforce stricter rules. Old data may violate new constraints. |
| **Adding new required property** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | Breaking change: old data lacks the field, new consumers require it. |
| **Removing required property** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | Breaking change: old data has the field, new consumers don't expect it. |
| **Renaming property** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | Breaking change: equivalent to remove + add. |
| **Changing property type (incompatible)** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | Breaking change unless using union types. |


### 4.4 GTS Versions Compatibility Examples

This section demonstrates how different types of schema changes affect compatibility between minor versions of the same GTS type. We take as example Event Management system and typical events structure, however it can be used for any other data schemas in the system

#### 4.4.1 Forward Compatibility Example

**Use case**: Configuration schemas where old systems must tolerate new config options.

**Schema v1.0** (`gts.x.core.db.connection_config.v1.0~`):
```json
{
  "$id": "gts.x.core.db.connection_config.v1.0~",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["host", "port", "database"],
  "properties": {
    "host": { "type": "string" },
    "port": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 65535 },
    "database": { "type": "string" },
    "timeout": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "default": 30 }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Schema v1.1** (adds required field):
```json
{
  "$id": "gts.x.core.db.connection_config.v1.1~",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["host", "port", "database", "timeout"],
  "properties": {
    "host": { "type": "string" },
    "port": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 65535 },
    "database": { "type": "string" },
    "timeout": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 1 }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Compatibility analysis**:
- ✅ **Forward**: v1.0 consumer can read v1.1 data (`timeout` is optional in v1.0 with default value)
- ❌ **Backward**: v1.1 consumer **rejects** v1.0 data (missing required `timeout`)
- ❌ **Full**: Not fully compatible

**Deployment strategy**: Update config producers to always include `timeout`, then update consumers to v1.1.

**Config examples**:
```json
// v1.0 config (rejected by v1.1 because timeout is now required)
{"host": "db.example.com", "port": 5432, "database": "mydb"}

// v1.1 config (valid for both schemas)
{"host": "db.example.com", "port": 5432, "database": "mydb", "timeout": 60}
```

#### 4.4.2 Backward Compatibility Example (Closed Model)

**Use case**: Event schemas where producers and consumers can be deployed independently.

**Base event schema v1** (`gts.x.core.events.type.v1~`)
```json
{
  "$id": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["gtsId", "id", "timestamp"],
  "properties": {
    "gtsId": { "type": "string" },
    "id": { "type": "string" },
    "timestamp": { "type": "integer" },
    "payload": { "type": "object", "additionalProperties": true }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Schema v1.0** (`gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.api.users.create_request.v1.0~`):
```json
{
  "$id": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.api.users.create_request.v1.0~",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~" },
    {
      "properties": {
        "payload": {
          "type": "object",
          "required": ["email", "name"],
          "properties": {
            "email": { "type": "string", "format": "email" },
            "name": { "type": "string" }
          },
          "additionalProperties": false
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Schema v1.1** (adds optional field):
```json
{
  "$id": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.api.users.create_request.v1.1~",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~" },
    {
      "properties": {
        "payload": {
          "type": "object",
          "required": ["email", "name"],
          "properties": {
            "email": { "type": "string", "format": "email" },
            "name": { "type": "string" },
            "phoneNumber": { "type": "string" }
          },
          "additionalProperties": false
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Compatibility analysis**:
- ❌ **Forward**: v1.0 server **rejects** v1.1 requests (closed model with `additionalProperties: false` rejects unknown `phoneNumber`)
- ✅ **Backward**: v1.1 server can process v1.0 requests (missing `phoneNumber` is optional)
- ❌ **Full**: Not fully compatible

**Deployment strategy**: Update servers to v1.1 first, then gradually update clients.

**Request payload examples**:
```json
// v1.0 request payload (valid for both schemas)
{"email": "user@example.com", "name": "John Doe"}

// v1.1 request payload (rejected by v1.0 server due to additionalProperties: false)
{"email": "user@example.com", "name": "John Doe", "phoneNumber": "+1234567890"}
```

#### 4.4.3 Full Compatibility Example (Open Model)

**Schema v1.0** (`gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.0~`):
```json
{
  "$id": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.0~",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~" },
    {
      "properties": {
        "payload": {
          "type": "object",
          "required": ["orderId", "customerId", "totalAmount"],
          "properties": {
            "orderId": { "type": "string" },
            "customerId": { "type": "string" },
            "totalAmount": { "type": "number" }
          },
          "additionalProperties": true
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Schema v1.1** (adds optional field):
```json
{
  "$id": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.1~",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~" },
    {
      "properties": {
        "payload": {
          "type": "object",
          "required": ["orderId", "customerId", "totalAmount"],
          "properties": {
            "orderId": { "type": "string" },
            "customerId": { "type": "string" },
            "totalAmount": { "type": "number" },
            "currency": { "type": "string", "default": "USD" }
          },
          "additionalProperties": true
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Compatibility analysis**:
- ✅ **Backward**: v1.1 consumers can read v1.0 data (missing `currency` field is handled via default)
- ✅ **Forward**: v1.0 consumers can read v1.1 data (open model ignores unknown `currency` field)
- ✅ **Full**: Fully compatible—deploy in any order

**Event payload examples**:
```json
// v1.0 data (valid for both schemas)
{"orderId": "123", "customerId": "456", "totalAmount": 99.99}

// v1.1 data (valid for v1.1, readable by v1.0 due to open model)
{"orderId": "123", "customerId": "456", "totalAmount": 99.99, "currency": "EUR"}
```

> **Note**: Changes to referenced GTS identifier values do not affect full compatibility. For example, the following two schemas are treated as fully compatible even though they reference different const values:

```jsonc
{
  "$id": (
      "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.1~"
  ),
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
      {"$$ref": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~"},
      {
          "type": "object",
          "required": ["type", "payload"],
          "properties": {
              "type": {
                  "const": (
                      "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.1~"
                  )
              },
          }
      }
  ]
}
```

```jsonc
{
  "$id": (
      "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.2~"
  ),
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
      {"$$ref": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~"},
      {
          "type": "object",
          "required": ["type", "payload"],
          "properties": {
              "type": {
                  "const": (
                      "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.2~" // GTS ID changed to v1.2
                  )
              },
          }
      }
  ]
}
```


#### 4.4.4 Type Derivation vs Version Evolution

**Important distinction**: Type derivation (chaining) is different from version evolution:

```json
// Base type (always compatible with derived types)
"$id": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~"

// Derived type v1.0 (refines base type)
"$id": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.0~"

// Derived type v1.1 (minor version of the derived type)
"$id": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.1~"
```

**Compatibility rules**:
1. `order_placed.v1.0~` is **always fully compatible** with base `type.v1~` (derivation)
2. `order_placed.v1.1~` is **always fully compatible** with base `type.v1~` (derivation)
3. `order_placed.v1.1~` compatibility with `order_placed.v1.0~` depends on the changes made (version evolution—see examples above)

See the [examples folder](./examples/events/schemas/) for complete schema definitions demonstrating these patterns.


### 4.5 Best Practices for Schema Evolution

To maximize compatibility and minimize breaking changes between the minor versions of the same GTS type, follow these recommendations:

1. **Make new properties optional with defaults**: This is the safest way to add fields. Use `default` keyword in JSON Schema.

2. **Never remove or rename required properties**: Always a breaking change. Increment MAJOR version instead.

3. **Deprecate instead of removing**: Mark fields as deprecated in documentation. Keep them in the schema for at least one MAJOR version.

4. **Avoid changing field types**: Type changes are almost always breaking. To evolve a type, use union types: `"type": ["string", "number"]`.

5. **Use a schema registry**: Centralize schema management and enforce compatibility checks before allowing new versions to be published.


## 5. Typical Use-cases

### 5.1 Practical Benefits for Service and Platform Vendors

Besides being a universal identifier, GTS provides concrete, production-ready capabilities that solve common architectural challenges for platform vendors and service providers integrating multiple third-party services under single control plane:

#### Type Safety and Evolution
- **Automated compatibility checking**: Validate schema changes against backward/forward/full compatibility rules before deployment (see section 4.3)
- **Safe schema evolution**: Add optional fields to open models without breaking existing consumers or requiring coordinated deployments
- **Version casting**: Automatically upcast/downcast data between minor versions (e.g., process v1.2 data with v1.0 consumer)
- **Breaking change detection**: Prevent accidental breaking changes through automated validation in CI/CD pipelines

#### Multi-Vendor Extensibility
- **Plugin architectures**: Allow third-party vendors to extend platform base types while maintaining compatibility guarantees (see section 3.2)
- **Hybrid storage**: Store common fields in indexed columns, vendor-specific extensions in JSONB—no schema migrations needed (see section 3.2 implementation pattern)
- **Vendor isolation**: Use GTS chains to track data provenance and enforce vendors' data boundaries in shared databases
- **Zero-downtime extensions**: Register new derived types without altering existing tables or restarting services

#### Access Control and Security
- **Wildcard-based policies**: Grant object access permissions using patterns like `gts.vendor.package.*` instead of maintaining explicit lists (see section 3.5)
- **Attribute-based filtering**: Combine GTS identifiers with predicates for fine-grained access control (see section 3.3)
- **Chain-aware authorization**: Restrict access to specific vendor extensions while allowing base type access
- **Audit trails**: Log GTS identifiers for complete traceability of data access and schema usage

#### Developer Experience
- **Human-readable identifiers**: Debug issues by reading event types, config schemas, or API payloads directly from logs
- **Self-documenting APIs**: GTS identifiers encode vendor, package, namespace, and version—no external documentation lookup needed
- **Schema registries**: Build centralized catalogs where schemas are indexed by GTS identifiers for discovery and validation
- **Deterministic UUIDs**: Generate stable UUID v5 from GTS identifiers for external systems requiring opaque IDs. The UUID5 namespace is ns:URL + 'gts':

```python
import uuid
GTS_NS = uuid.uuid5(uuid.NAMESPACE_URL, "gts")
print(uuid.uuid5(GTS_NS, "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~"))
print(uuid.uuid5(GTS_NS, "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~abc.app._.custom_event.v1.2"))
```


### 5.2 Example: Multi-Vendor Event Management Platform

**Practical Scenario:**

Consider a vendor, `X`, who operates a multi-tenant event management platform. This platform acts as a broker, receiving events from various producers (e.g., third-party applications) and routing them to the correct handlers. According to the platform's specification, every event must contain a `gtsId` field that references a registered event schema. This allows the platform to validate, authorize, and route events of different kinds, such as general-purpose events, audit logs, and custom messages.

Now, imagine a second vendor, `ABC`, develops an application named `APP` that runs on vendor `X`'s platform. When a customer makes an online purchase within `APP`, the application needs to emit a `store.purchase_audit_event` to the event manager.

In this scenario, vendor `X`'s platform must be able to:
1.  **Authorize** the incoming event, ensuring that vendor `ABC` is permitted to emit it.
2.  **Validate** the event's structure against the correct schema.
3.  **Ensure data isolation**, making the event visible only to authorized parties (e.g., vendor `ABC`'s `APP` administrators) and not to other tenants.

Let's define the schemas required to implement this.

First, let's define the base event schema for vendor `X` event manager:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~",
  "title": "Base Event",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "gtsId": { "type": "string", "$comment": "This field serves as the unique identifier for the event schema" },
    "id": { "type": "string", "$comment": "This field serves as the unique identifier for the event instance" },
    "timestamp": { "type": "integer", "$comment": "timestamp in seconds since epoch" },
    "payload": { "type": "object", "additionalProperties": true, "$comment": "Event payload... can be anything" }
  },
  "required": ["gtsId", "id", "timestamp", "payload"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

Now, let's define the audit event schema for vendor `X` event manager:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core.audit.event.v1~",
  "title": "Audit Event, derived from Base Event",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~" },
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "payload": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "user_id": { "type": "string", "$comment": "User ID" },
            "user_agent": { "type": "string", "$comment": "User agent" },
            "ip_address": { "type": "string", "$comment": "IP address" },
            "data": { "type": "object", "additionalProperties": true, "$comment": "Audit event custom data... can be anything" }
          },
          "required": ["user_id", "user_agent", "ip_address", "data"],
          "additionalProperties": false
        }
      },
      "required": ["payload"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Then, let's define the schema of specific audit event registered by vendor `ABC` application `APP`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core.audit.event.v1~abc.app.store.purchase_audit_event.v1.2~",
  "title": "Vendor ABC Custom Purchase Audit Event from app APP",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core.audit.event.v1~" },
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "payload": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "data": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "purchase_id": { "type": "string" },
                "amount": { "type": "number" },
                "currency": { "type": "string" },
                "price": { "type": "number" }
              },
              "required": ["purchase_id", "amount", "currency", "price"],
              "additionalProperties": false
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "required": ["payload"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Finally, when the producer (the application `APP` of vendor `ABC`) emits the event, it uses the `gtsId` to identify the event schema and provide required payload:

```json
{
  "gtsId": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core.audit.event.v1~abc.app.store.purchase_audit_event.v1.2~",
  "id": "e81307e5-5ee8-4c0a-8d1f-bd98a65c517e",
  "timestamp": 1743466200000000000,
  "payload": {
    "user_id": "9c905ae1-f0f3-4cfb-aa07-5d9a86219abe",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)",
    "ip_address": "127.0.0.1",
    "data": {
      "purchase_id": "cats_drinking_bowl_42",
      "amount": 2,
      "currency": "USD",
      "price": 19.95
    }
  }
}
```

When the event manager receives the event it processes it as follows:

1. **Schema Resolution**: Parse the `gtsId` to identify the full chain. The event manager can see that this instance conforms to `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~`, `...~x.core.audit.event.v1~`, and finally `...~abc.app.store.purchase_audit_event.v1.2~`.

2. **Validation**: Load the most specific JSON Schema (`...~abc.app.store.purchase_audit_event.v1.2~`) and validate the event object against it. It would automatically mean the event body is validated against any other schema in the chain (e.g., the base event and the base audit event).

3. **Authorization**: Check if the producer is authorized to emit events matching the pattern `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core.audit.event.v1~abc.app.*` or a broader pattern like `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core.audit.event.v1~abc.*`.

4. **Routing & Auditing**: Use the chain to route events to appropriate handlers or storage if needed.

> **Note**: use the [GTS Kit](https://github.com/globaltypesystem/gts-kit) for visualization of the entities relationship and validation

See some other definitions in the [examples folder](./examples/)


### 5.3 Schema Registry Requirement

> **Critical implementation requirement:** The architectural guarantees of GTS—particularly type safety across inheritance chains and safe minor version evolution—depend entirely on a stateful **GTS Schema Registry** component. Production systems MUST implement or integrate a registry capable of:
>
> 1. **Storing and indexing** all registered GTS schemas by their type identifiers
> 2. **Validating compatibility** of new schema versions against existing versions using the precise rules defined in section 4.3 before publication
> 3. **Enforcing inheritance constraints** to ensure derived types remain compatible with their base types
> 4. **Rejecting incompatible changes** that violate the declared compatibility mode (backward/forward/full)
> 5. **Providing schema resolution** for validation, casting, and relationship resolution operations
>
> Without a registry performing rigorous schema diffing and compatibility validation, the type safety guarantees of GTS cannot be maintained. Implementations should treat the registry as a critical infrastructure component, similar to a database or message broker.


## 6. Implementation-defined and Non-goals

This specification intentionally does not enforce several operational or governance choices. It is up to the implementation vendor to define policies and behavior for:

1. Whether a defined type is exported (published) and available for cross-vendor use via APIs or an event bus.
2. Whether a given JSON/JSON Schema definition is mutable or immutable (e.g., handling an incompatible change without changing the minor or major version).
3. How to implement access policies and access checks based on the GTS query and attribute access languages.
4. When to introduce a new minor version versus a new major version.
5. GTS identifiers renaming and aliasing
6. Exact GTS identifier minor version compatibility rules enforcement (backward, forward, full)

> **Non-goals reminder**: GTS is not an eventing framework, transport, or workflow. It standardizes identifiers and basic validation/casting semantics around JSON and JSON Schema.


## 7. Comparison with other identifiers

- JSONSchema $schema url: While JSONSchema provides a robust framework for defining the structure of JSON data, GTS extends this by offering clear vendor, package and namespace notation and chaining making it easier to track and validate data instances across different systems and versions.
- UUID: Opaque and globally unique. GTS is meaningful to humans and machines; UUIDs can be derived from GTS deterministically when opaque IDs are required.
- Apple UTI: Human-readable, reverse-DNS-like. GTS is similar in readability but adds explicit versioning, vendors/apps support, chaining, and schema/instance distinction suitable for JSON Schema-based validation.
- Amazon ARN: Global and structured, but cloud-service-specific. GTS is vendor-neutral and domain-agnostic, focused on data schemas and instances.


## 8. Parsing and Validation

### 8.1 Single-segment regex (type or instance)

Single-chain variant:

```regex
^gts\.([a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)\.([a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)\.([a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)\.([a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)\.v(0|[1-9]\d*)(?:\.(0|[1-9]\d*))?~?$
```

Verbose, named groups (Python `re.VERBOSE`):

```regex
^\s*
gts\.
(?P<vendor>[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)\.
(?P<package>[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)\.
(?P<namespace>[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)\.
(?P<type>[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)
\.v(?P<major>0|[1-9]\d*)
(?:\.(?P<minor>0|[1-9]\d*))?
(?P<is_type>~)?
\s*$
```

`is_type` captures the optional trailing `~` (present for type IDs, absent for instance IDs).

### 8.2 Chained identifier regex

For chained identifiers, the pattern enforces that all segments except the last are type IDs (with `~` separators):

```regex
^\s*gts\.[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*\.[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*\.[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*\.[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*\.v(0|[1-9]\d*)(?:\.(0|[1-9]\d*))?(?:~[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*\.[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*\.[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*\.[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*\.v(0|[1-9]\d*)(?:\.(0|[1-9]\d*))?)*~?\s*$
```

**Pattern explanation:**
- Starts with a single absolute segment (`gts.` prefix)
- Followed by zero or more relative segments, each prefixed by `~`
- The final `~` is optional: present for a type, absent for an instance

**Validation rules:**
1. Standalone type identifier: MUST end with `~`
2. In a chain, all segments except the rightmost MUST be types (end with `~` in the original string)
3. Only the first segment uses the `gts.` prefix; chained segments are relative (no `gts.`)

**Parsing strategy:**
- Split on `~` to get raw segments; the first is absolute, the rest are relative
- Parse the first using the absolute pattern, the rest using the relative pattern
- Validate that all segments except possibly the last are types


## 9. Reference Implementation Recommendations

GTS specification provides recommendations for reference implementation of the core operations for working with GTS identifiers. These recommendations are not mandatory but are provided to help implementers understand the expected behavior of appropriate reference implementations in different programming languages.

For existing reference implementations, refer to the official libraries:

- [gts-python](https://www.github.com/GlobalTypeSystem/gts-python)
- [gts-go](https://www.github.com/GlobalTypeSystem/gts-go)
- [gts-rust](https://www.github.com/GlobalTypeSystem/gts-rust)

### 9.1 - GTS operations (OP#1–OP#11):

Implement and expose all operations OP#1–OP#11 listed above and add appropriate unit tests.

- **OP#1 - ID Validation**: Verify identifier syntax
- **OP#2 - ID Extraction**: Extract identifiers from JSON objects or JSON Schema documents
- **OP#3 - ID Parsing**: Decompose identifiers into constituent parts (vendor, package, namespace, type, version, etc.)
- **OP#4 - ID Pattern Matching**: Match identifiers against patterns containing wildcards
- **OP#5 - ID to UUID Mapping**: Generate deterministic UUIDs from GTS identifiers
- **OP#6 - Schema Validation**: Validate object instances against their corresponding schemas
- **OP#7 - Relationship Resolution**: Load schemas and instances, resolve inter-dependencies, and detect broken references
- **OP#8 - Compatibility Checking**: Verify that schemas with different MINOR versions are compatible
- **OP#9 - Version Casting**: Transform instances between compatible MINOR versions
- **OP#10 - Query Execution**: Filter identifier collections using the GTS query language
- **OP#11 - Attribute Access**: Retrieve property values and metadata using the attribute selector (`@`)


### 9.2 - GTS entities registration

Implement simple GTS instances in-memory registry with optional GTS entities validation on registration. If "validation" parameter enabled, the entity registration action must ensure that all the GTS references are valid - identitfiers must match GTS pattern, refererred entities must be registered, the x-gts-ref references must be valid (see below)

### 9.3 - CLI support

Provide a CLI wrapping OPs for local use and CI: e.g., `gts validate`, `gts parse`, `gts match`, `gts uuid`, `gts compat`, `gts cast`, `gts query`, `gts get`. Use non-zero exit codes on validation/compatibility failures for pipeline integration.

### 9.4 - Web server with OpenAPI

Implement an HTTP server that conforms to `tests/openapi.json` so it can be tested from this specification directory.

```
# 1. Start appropriate server, normally as 'gts server'
# 2. Test it's conformance to required openapi.json by running specification tests:
pytest ./tests
```

### 9.5 - `x-gts-ref` support

Use `x-gts-ref` in GTS schemas (JSON schemas) to declare that a string field is a GTS entity reference, not an arbitrary string; validators must enforce this.

Allowed values:
- `"x-gts-ref": "gts.*"` — field must be a valid GTS identifier (see OP#1); optionally resolve against a registry if available.
- `"x-gts-ref": "/$id"` — relative self-reference; field value must equal the current schema’s `$id` ("/" refers to the JSON Schema document root, `$id` is its identifier). The referred field must be a GTS string or another `x-gts-ref` field.

See examples in `./examples/modules` for typical patterns.

Implementation notes:

- Treating `x-gts-ref` like JSON Schema string constraints:
  - When the value is a literal starting with `gts.` (e.g., `gts.x.core.modules.capability.v1~`), it can be enforced similarly to a `startsWith(...)` check by validating the instance value against the provided GTS prefix (sections 8.1/8.2). Implementations must also validate the GTS ID.
  - When the value is a relative path like `./$id` or `./description`, resolve it as a JSON Pointer relative to the schema root. If the pointer doesn't resolve to a GTS string or another `x-gts-ref` field, an error must be reported.
  - For nested paths (e.g., `./properties/id`), resolve the pointer accordinly to the field path in the JSON Schema document.


### 9.6 - YAML support

Accept and emit both JSON and YAML (`.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`) for schemas and instances.
Ensure conversions are lossless; preserve `$id`, `gtsId`, and custom extensions like `x-gts-ref`.

### 9.7 - TypeSpec support

Support generating JSON Schema and OpenAPI from TypeSpec while preserving GTS semantics.
Ensure generated schemas use GTS identifiers as `$id` for types and keep any `x-gts-*` extensions intact.

### 9.8 - UUID as object IDs

Support UUIDs (format: `uuid`) for instance `id` fields.


## 10. Collecting Identifiers with Wildcards

**Important:** An identifier containing a wildcard (`*`) is a **pattern for matching** and may not serve as a canonical identifier for a type or instance.

A single wildcard (`*`) character can be used to find all identifiers matching a given prefix. The wildcard is a greedy operator that matches any sequence of characters after it, including the `~` chain separator.

**Rules for using wildcards:**
1. The wildcard (`*`) must be used only **once**.
2. The wildcard must appear at the **end** of the pattern.
3. The wildcard must not be used in combination with an attribute selector (`@`) or query (`[]`).
4. The pattern must start at the beginning of a valid segment. For example, `gts.x.llm.chat.msg*` is invalid if `msg` is not a complete segment. `gts.x.llm.chat.message.v*` is valid because `v` is the start of the version segment.
5. **Minor version semantics**: When a pattern specifies only a major version (e.g., `v0.*`), it matches candidates with any minor version of that major version (e.g., `v0.1~`, `v0.2~`, etc.). This is because the minor version is optional, and omitting it semantically means "any minor version".

**Valid Examples:**

Given the following identifiers:
```
gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1.0~
gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1.0~x.llm.system_message.v1.0~
gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1.1~
gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1.1~x.llm.user_message.v1.1~
```

- **Pattern:** `gts.x.llm.chat.message.*` - Find all base schemas versions and their derived schemas
  - **Result:** All four identifiers listed above.

- **Pattern:** `gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1.*` - Find all base and deriver types from v1 (any minor version)
  - **Result:** All four identifiers (matches both `v1.0~` and `v1.1~` because pattern without minor version matches any minor version)

- **Pattern:** `gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1~*` - Find all derived types from v1 (any minor version)
  - **Result:** two derived entities: `gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1.0~x.llm.system_message.v1.0~`, `gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1.1~x.llm.user_message.v1.1~`

- **Pattern:** `gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1.0~*` - Find all derived types (schemas) down the chain
  - **Result:** Only one matching entity: `gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1.0~x.llm.system_message.v1.0~`


**Minor Version Matching Examples:**

The following examples demonstrate the special case where patterns without minor versions match candidates with any minor version:

```
Pattern:   gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0~*
Candidate: gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0.1~
Result:    ✅ MATCH (pattern v0~ matches any v0.x)

Pattern:   gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0~*
Candidate: gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0~
Result:    ✅ MATCH (exact match)

Pattern:   gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0.1~*
Candidate: gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0.1~
Result:    ✅ MATCH (exact match with minor version)

Pattern:   gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0~abc.*
Candidate: gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0.1~
Result:    ❌ NO MATCH (pattern v0~abc.* does not match any v0.x)

Pattern:   gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0.1~*
Candidate: gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0.2~
Result:    ❌ NO MATCH (different minor versions)

Pattern:   gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0~*
Candidate: gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v1.0~
Result:    ❌ NO MATCH (different major versions)
```

**Invalid Pattern Examples:**
- `gts.x.llm.chat.msg*` - Invalid if `msg` is not a complete segment.
- `gts.x.llm.chat.message.v*~*` - Multiple wildcards are used.


## 11. JSON and JSON Schema Conventions

It is advisable to include instance GTS identifiers in a top-level field, such as `gtsId`. However, the choice of the specific field name is left to the discretion of the implementation and can vary from service to service.

**Example #1**: **instance definition** of an object instance (event topic) that has a `gtsId` field that encodes the object type (`gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~`) and identifies the object itself (`x.core.idp.events.v1`). In the example below it makes no sense to add an additional `id` field because the `gtsId` is already unique and there are no other event topics with the given id in the system:

```json
{
  "gtsId": "gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~x.core.idp.events.v1",
  "description": "User-related events (creation, profile changes, etc.)",
  "retention": "P30D",
  "ordering": "by-partition-key",
}
```

**Example #2**: **instance definition** of an object that has a `gtsId` field that encodes the object type, but also its own integer identifier of the object:

```json
[{
    "gtsId": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core.idp.events.v1~",
    "id": "123",
    "payload": { "foo": "123", "bar": 42 }
},
{
    "gtsId": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core.idp.events.v1~",
    "id": "125",
    "payload": { "foo": "xyz", "bar": 123 }
}]
```

**Example #3**: **schema definition** of an event type with the `$id` field equal to the type identifier (ending with `~`):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "gtsId": { "type": "string" },
    "timestamp": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" },
    "payload": { "type": "object" }
  },
  "required": ["gtsId", "payload"]
}
```


## 12. Notes and Best Practices

- Prefer chains where the base system type is first, followed by vendor-specific refinements, and finally the instance.
- Favor additive changes in MINOR versions. Use a new MAJOR for breaking changes.
- Keep types small and cohesive; use `namespace` to group related types within a package.


## 13. Testing

See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md)


## 14. Registered Vendors

The GTS specification does not require vendors to publish their types publicly, but we encourage them to submit their vendor codes to prevent future conflicts.

Currently registered vendors:

| Vendor | Description       |
|--------|-------------------|
| x      | example vendor    |
