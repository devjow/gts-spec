#
# Test dependencies for the GTS specification test suite.
#
# NOTE:
# - The tests currently use `httprunner`, which depends on `pydantic` v1.
# - On Python 3.12, older `pydantic` v1 releases may crash during import with:
#   "ForwardRef._evaluate() missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'recursive_guard'"
#   (because Python 3.12 changed the ForwardRef API).
# - Pin `pydantic` to a Python-3.12-compatible v1 range to keep tests importable.
